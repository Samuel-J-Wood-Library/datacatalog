        <p>
            As per the Cornell University Policy, long term integrity of the research record requires that
            research data be preserved in sufficient detail and for an adequate period of time to enable appropriate
            responses to questions about accuracy, authenticity, primacy, and compliance with laws and regulations
            governing the research.
        </p>

            according to the specific situation.
