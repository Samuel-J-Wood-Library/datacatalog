            <a href="https://policy.cornell.edu/policy-library/research-data-retention" target="_blank">
                Data Retention Policy</a>, to ensure the integrity of the research process and to comply
            with sponsor and/or federal regulations, the university must retain research data in sufficient
            detail and for an adequate period of time to enable appropriate responses to questions about
            accuracy, authenticity, primacy, and compliance with laws and regulations governing the
            research.

            <li>Project completion: The WRG project ID</li>
